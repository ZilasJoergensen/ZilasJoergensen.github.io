                        Console Monsters is a Pokèmon esque game that I started with a friend
                        <br><br>
                        It's all been created in the C# Console Application and is meant for the 'dotnet-console-games'
                        repo that my friend has created to teach and inspire newcomers to C#.
                        <br><br>
                        All the code is open source and we've made a Discord so other people can join in the development
                        no matter skill.
                        The game is still in development (15/11/22).

                        This is a project made in Processing which is a langauge derived from Java but has 
                        extra design features which is the core point of it.
                        <br><br>
                        Here I've made snake which was a super simple project where I was mostly
                        focused on the design and robustness (no bugs and so on) of the game.
                        <br><br>
                        After I was done with the game I decided to make it "multiplayer"
                        in the sense of using websockets so it in theory would work on 2 different PC's.
                        I got it working but was never fully tested and a few bugs.
